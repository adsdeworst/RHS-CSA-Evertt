    //    - Tweaking how the world is build, look at the app\World.java code to start.
    //    - Adding a light on the player/camera. This would require adding code to the
    //          shaders used for the world (res\worldDefault.vert & res\worldDefault.frag).

    //          and are familar with how lighting works in games.
